# 100 days of Web Design

## Day 4 Vue

Today I did a junior level project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The project I did was called [Time Tracking Dashboard](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw). With this project I needed to import a json file with the times spent on each of the activities and show the right time based on whether you wanted to see the daily, weekly, or monthly times. After using Petite Vue yesterday, I decided to use Vue today.

### What is Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a versitile JavaScript framework originally meant as a replacement for [Angular](https://angular.io/) for small development teams, it has since evolved into it's own thing. Currently, Vue is the 9th most starred Github page and the most starred JavaScript Framework. Unlike React and Angular, Vue doesn't have a major tech corporation behind it, yet it is still very popular and widly used.

### Did I enjoy using Vue

I definitely enjoyed using Vue. The way Vue brings the JavaScript into the HTML makes more sense to me than bringing the HTML into the JavaScript like React. I have also used Svelte in the past and I feel that Svelte simplifys things more than Vue. I will certainly be using and learning more about Vue throughout the next 100 days.
